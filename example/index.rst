   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Example's documentation!
===================================

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

.. admonition:: Hello
   :name: one admonition
   :class: one admonition class

   This is one admonition

.. item:: 00001
   :name: First item
   :class: important

   We have to extend this section

This text is not part of any item

.. item:: 00002
   :name: Second title
   :class: not_so_important secondary

   Clean up all this.
